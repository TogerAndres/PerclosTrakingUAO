Real-time drowsiness and visual fatigue detection system based on the PERCLOS (Percentage of Eye Closure) index.
The system uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect faces, track eyes, and analyze blink patterns. It calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and applies a duration threshold to identify possible drowsiness events.
